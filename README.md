OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
Project :Temperature and humidity monitoring with DHT sensor
Objective : The objective of the temperature and humidity monitoring project using a DHT sensor is to accurately measure and log environmental conditions, providing real-time data visualization and historical trends. It aims to trigger alerts when thresholds are exceeded and integrate with other systems for automated responses, ensuring reliable and efficient monitoring.
Key activities:
1. Sensor Integration: Connect and configure the DHT sensor with a microcontroller or development board (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi).
2. Data Collection: Program the system to read temperature and humidity data from the sensor at regular intervals.
3. Data Storage: Implement methods to log data locally or in a cloud database with timestamps.
4. Data Visualization: Develop a user interface to display real-time and historical data through graphs and charts.
5. Alert Mechanisms: Set up alerts and notifications for threshold breaches via email, SMS, or other means.
6. System Testing: Test the entire system for accuracy, reliability, and power efficiency, making necessary adjustments.
7. Integration and Deployment: Integrate with other IoT devices and deploy the system in the desired environment for continuous monitoring.
 1. Hardware:
   DHT Sensor (DHT11 or DHT22) for measuring temperature and humidity.
   Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, ESP8266, ESP32) or *Single-board Computer* (e.g., Raspberry Pi) for interfacing with the sensor.
   Power Supply for powering the system.
2. Software:
   Programming Languages: Python, C/C++ (for Arduino), or MicroPython for writing sensor data acquisition and processing code.
   Data Logging: Local storage (e.g., SD card) or cloud databases (e.g., Firebase, AWS IoT) for storing collected data.
   Data Visualization: Web frameworks (e.g., Flask, Django) or IoT platforms (e.g., ThingSpeak) for creating user interfaces and visualizations.
3. Communication Protocols:
   I2C/SPI: For sensor communication with the microcontroller.
   Wi-Fi/Bluetooth: For wireless data transmission and remote monitoring.
4. Development and Testing Tools:
   IDE: Arduino IDE, Thonny (for Python), or Visual Studio Code.
   Version Control: Git for source code management andÂ collaboration
